## Systematic Approach to Reach 1200+

### Category Distribution (Final Target)

| Category | Current | Target | Remaining |
|----------|---------|--------|-----------|
| Chest | 25 | 150 | 125 |
| Back | 20 | 200 | 180 |
| Shoulders | 18 | 150 | 132 |
| Arms | 10 | 120 | 110 |
| Legs | 7 | 300 | 293 |
| Core | 5 | 150 | 145 |
| Full Body | 5 | 100 | 95 |
| Accessories | 3 | 30 | 27 |
| **TOTAL** | **106** | **1200** | **1094** |

### Exercise Generation Strategy

**Option 1: Manual Creation** (Recommended for quality)
- Use force-exercises-comprehensive-v2.ts as template
- Create systematic variations for each category
- Ensure comprehensive coverage of all equipment
- Include progressive difficulty levels

**Option 2: Semi-Automated**
- Use existing templates to generate variations
- Systematic naming conventions
- Auto-generate muscle groups based on movement
- Manual review for quality

**Option 3: AI-Assisted** (Future enhancement)
- Generate exercises using AI (GPT-4)
- Validate against exercise database standards
- Manual curation before insertion

  ARRAY[(SELECT id FROM equipment_types WHERE name = 'dumbbells')],
  'force',
  'intermediate',
  'home',
  50
);
```
