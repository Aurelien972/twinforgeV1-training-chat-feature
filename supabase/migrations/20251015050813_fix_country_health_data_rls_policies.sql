  # Fix RLS Policies for country_health_data

  1. Problem
    - Current RLS only allows service_role to INSERT/UPDATE on country_health_data
    - Authenticated users need to be able to enrich country data
    - This causes 403 errors when countryHealthEnrichmentService tries to save data

  2. Changes
    - Add INSERT policy for authenticated users on country_health_data
    - Add UPDATE policy for authenticated users on country_health_data
    - Keep service_role policy for full admin access
    - Users can only modify their own country's data or create new entries

  3. Security
    - Authenticated users can read all country data (needed for lookups)
    - Authenticated users can insert/update country data (collaborative enrichment)
    - Service role maintains full control for admin operations
    - Conflicts handled via ON CONFLICT in application code
