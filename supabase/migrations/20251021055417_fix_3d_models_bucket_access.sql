  # Fix 3D Models Bucket Access - Enable Base Model Signed URLs

  ## Problem
  Users cannot generate signed URLs for base 3D models (M_character_uniq.glb, F_character_uniq_4.13.glb)
  even though the RLS policy allows SELECT access. The issue is that signed URL generation requires
  explicit object existence check which fails with the current policy structure.

  ## Root Cause
  The current policy uses `name NOT LIKE '%/%'` condition which should allow access to root-level files,
  but Supabase's signed URL generation performs additional checks that require a more explicit policy.

  ## Solution
  Create a dedicated policy specifically for base model access that explicitly allows all authenticated
  users to access the base model files. This ensures signed URL generation works correctly.

  ## Changes
  1. Drop the overly complex existing policy
  2. Create two separate policies:
     - One for base models (M_character_uniq.glb, F_character_uniq_4.13.glb) - accessible to ALL authenticated users
     - One for user-specific custom models - restricted to owner only
  3. Maintain service_role full access

  ## Security
  - Base models are NOT sensitive (they are generic templates)
  - User-specific models remain private (user isolation maintained)
  - Service role retains full access for backend operations
