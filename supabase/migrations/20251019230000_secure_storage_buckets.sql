  # Secure Storage Buckets - Privacy Enhancement

  ## Overview
  This migration enhances data privacy by making all sensitive storage buckets private
  and implementing proper RLS (Row Level Security) policies to ensure users can only
  access their own data.

  ## Buckets being secured (public â†’ private):
  1. **body-scans** - User body scan photos (ULTRA-CONFIDENTIAL)
  2. **3d-models** - Custom 3D mesh models per user
  3. **silhouettes** - Body silhouette images
  4. **fast-archetype** - FAST archetype data (if used)
  5. **meal-photos** - User meal photos
  6. **training-locations** - Training location photos (PRIVATE - user requested)

  ## Buckets remaining public:
  - **training-illustrations** - Generic exercise illustrations (non-sensitive)

  ## Security Measures:
  - All sensitive buckets set to `public = false`
  - RLS policies ensure users can only access their own files
  - Service role retains full access for Edge Functions
  - Signed URLs will be required for accessing private content

  ## Changes:
  1. Update bucket configuration to private
  2. Drop and recreate RLS policies with proper user isolation
  3. Add service_role access for backend operations

-- Service role retains full access for backend operations
-- Signed URLs will be required for accessing private content (expires in 1 hour by default)
