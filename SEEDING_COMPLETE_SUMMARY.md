## Issues Encountered & Resolved

### 1. Duplicate Exercises (49 skipped)
**Issue**: Many exercises already existed in the database with the same name/slug.

**Examples**:
- Bulgarian Split Squat
- Romanian Deadlift
- Barbell Bench Press
- Lat Pulldown
- Face Pull
- Plank
- Hanging Leg Raise

**Resolution**: Script correctly skipped duplicates. No data loss or corruption.

### 2. Muscle Group Mapping Warnings
**Issue**: Some muscle groups not found with exact French names.

**Examples**:
- "Core" (should map to "Abdominaux" or "Tronc")
- "Lats" (should map to "Dorsaux")
- "Dorsaux (Grand dorsal)" (too specific)
- "Pectoraux (partie haute)" (too specific)
- "Stabilisateurs" (not in reference data)

**Impact**: Exercises inserted without muscle group associations for unmapped names.

**Future Fix**: Update muscle group names in seed script to match database reference data or add missing muscle groups.

### 3. Equipment Naming Mismatches
**Issue**: Equipment names in French not matching database equipment types.

**Examples**:
- "Banc inclinable" → Should be "Incline Bench" or equivalent
- "Poulie haute/basse" → Should be "High/Low Cable"
- "Machine à mollets" → Should be "Calf Machine"
- "Ceinture lestée" → Should be "Weight Belt"
- "kettlebells" → Should be "Kettlebell"

**Impact**: Exercises inserted without equipment associations for unmapped names.

**Future Fix**: Standardize equipment names to match the 500+ equipment types in database.

## Database Verification Queries

### Total Force Exercises
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as total
FROM exercises
WHERE discipline = 'force';
-- Result: 107
```

### By Difficulty
```sql
SELECT difficulty, COUNT(*) as count
FROM exercises
WHERE discipline = 'force'
GROUP BY difficulty
ORDER BY count DESC;
-- beginner: 41
-- intermediate: 56
-- advanced: 10
```

### By Subcategory
```sql
SELECT subcategory, COUNT(*) as count
FROM exercises
WHERE discipline = 'force'
GROUP BY subcategory
ORDER BY count DESC;
-- Results show good distribution across muscle groups
```

### Recently Added
```sql
SELECT name, subcategory, difficulty
FROM exercises
WHERE discipline = 'force'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 20;
-- Shows newest exercises successfully inserted

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Data Quality)
1. **Fix Muscle Group Mappings**
   - Update exercise seed data to use exact muscle group names from database
   - Alternative: Add missing muscle groups to `muscle_groups` table
   - Run UPDATE queries to associate exercises with correct muscle groups

2. **Fix Equipment Mappings**
   - Standardize equipment names in seed script
   - Map French equipment names to database equipment types
   - Run UPDATE queries to associate exercises with equipment

3. **Categorize Uncategorized Exercises**
   - 55 exercises have `subcategory = null`
   - Add proper subcategories (chest, back, legs, etc.)

### Short-term (Expansion)
4. **Continue Catalog Expansion**
   - Current: 107 force exercises
   - Target: 1200+ force exercises
   - Strategy: Use `force-exercises-comprehensive-v2.ts` template
   - Add systematic variations for each muscle group

5. **Add Exercise Relationships**
   - Progressions (easier → harder versions)
   - Regressions (harder → easier versions)
   - Alternatives (similar exercises with different equipment)

6. **Generate Illustrations**
   - Priority: exercises with `illustration_priority >= 7`
   - Estimated: ~60 high-priority illustrations needed

### Medium-term (Integration)
7. **Test Search & Matching Functions**
   ```sql
   -- Test equipment-based search
   SELECT * FROM find_exercises_by_equipment(
     ARRAY[(SELECT id FROM equipment_types WHERE name = 'Dumbbell')],
     'force',
     'intermediate',
     'home',
     20
   );

   -- Test exercise substitutions
   SELECT * FROM suggest_exercise_substitutions(
     (SELECT id FROM exercises WHERE name = 'Barbell Bench Press' LIMIT 1),
     5
   );
   ```

8. **Frontend Integration**
   - Test exercise catalog display
   - Verify filtering and search
   - Test illustration loading
   - Validate coaching cues display
