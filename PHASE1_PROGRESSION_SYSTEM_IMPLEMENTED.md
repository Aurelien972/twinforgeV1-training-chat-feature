# Phase 1: Long-term Progression Tracking System - IMPLEMENTED

**Date**: 2025-10-29
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Objective**: Enable AI coaches to access complete user load history for intelligent progression

---

## üéØ Problem Solved

### Critical Limitations Identified
1. **Context collector limited to 30 sessions** - prevented long-term progression tracking
2. **No detailed load history** - AI coaches had to "guess" appropriate loads
3. **Only frequency/RPE averages transmitted** - no specific load progressions (e.g., 100kg ‚Üí 102.5kg)
4. **Coaches couldn't know exact previous performance** - weeks, months, even years of history unavailable

### User's Core Requirement
> "Les coachs doivent savoir exactement ce que les utilisateurs ont fait lors de leurs s√©ances pr√©c√©dentes (derni√®re semaine, mois, 6 mois, 1 an et +) et proposer des charges progressives (par exemple, si l'utilisateur a fait 100kg avant, proposer 102.5kg)."

## ‚ú® Implementation Summary

### 1. Database Infrastructure ‚úÖ

#### New Table: `training_exercise_load_history`
Created comprehensive table tracking every exercise performed with complete details:

**Schema:**
```sql
- id (uuid, primary key)
- user_id (uuid, FK to auth.users)
- session_id (uuid, FK to training_sessions)
- exercise_name (text) - normalized for matching
- exercise_display_name (text) - display name
- discipline (text) - force, functional, endurance, calisthenics, competitions
- performed_at (timestamptz)
- sets_prescribed, sets_completed (integer)
- reps_prescribed, reps_completed (jsonb)
- load_prescribed, load_completed (jsonb) - supports number or array
- rpe_reported (integer 1-10)
- tempo, rest_seconds
- muscle_groups (text[])
- equipment_used (text[])
- was_modified (boolean)
- modification_type (text)
```

**Optimized Indexes:**
- `(user_id, exercise_name, performed_at DESC)` - primary lookup
- `(session_id)` - session-based queries
- GIN index on `muscle_groups` - array searches
- `(user_id, discipline, performed_at DESC)` - discipline-specific queries
- `(user_id, performed_at DESC)` - recent performance queries

**Security:**
- RLS enabled
- Users can only access their own history
- Policies for SELECT, INSERT aligned with training_sessions

**Migration File:**
- `/supabase/migrations/20251029000000_create_exercise_load_history_system.sql`

### 2. Helper Functions ‚úÖ

#### `get_exercise_load_history(user_id, exercise_name, months)`
Returns complete load history for an exercise over specified months:
```sql
SELECT performed_at, sets_completed, reps_completed, load_completed,
       rpe_reported, was_modified
FROM training_exercise_load_history
WHERE user_id = $1 AND exercise_name = $2
  AND performed_at > now() - ($3 months)
ORDER BY performed_at DESC
```

#### `get_last_performed_load(user_id, exercise_name)`
Returns most recent load for an exercise:
```sql
SELECT load_completed
FROM training_exercise_load_history
WHERE user_id = $1 AND exercise_name = $2
ORDER BY performed_at DESC LIMIT 1
```

#### `get_exercise_frequency(user_id, exercise_name, days)`
Calculates how many times an exercise was performed in last N days:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM training_exercise_load_history
WHERE user_id = $1 AND exercise_name = $2
  AND performed_at > now() - ($3 days)
```

#### `get_progression_trend(user_id, exercise_name, months)`
Calculates load progression trend with statistics:
```json
{
  "first_load": 80.0,
  "last_load": 100.0,
  "absolute_increase": 20.0,
  "percentage_increase": 25.0,
  "sessions_analyzed": 12,
  "trend": "strong_progression" // or moderate_progression, plateau, regression
}
```

---

### 3. Historical Data Migration ‚úÖ

#### `migrate_exercise_history_from_sessions()`
Backfilled historical data from existing training_sessions:

**Results:**
- ‚úÖ 13 sessions processed
- ‚úÖ 16 exercises inserted
- ‚úÖ 0 errors
- ‚úÖ 15 unique exercises tracked
- ‚úÖ 1 user migrated
- ‚úÖ Discipline: endurance (running sessions)

**Supported Disciplines:**
- Force: extracts from `mainWorkout` array
- Functional: extracts from `blocks.exercises`
- Endurance: extracts from `mainWorkout` with interval data
- Calisthenics: ready for future data
- Competitions: ready for future data

---

### 4. Context Collector Enhancement ‚úÖ

#### New Function: `fetchExerciseLoadHistory()`
Added to `/supabase/functions/training-context-collector/index.ts`:

**Features:**
- Fetches 12 months of detailed load history
- Groups exercises by name for easy access
- Calculates progression statistics per exercise:
  ```typescript
  {
    exerciseName: {
      totalPerformances: 8,
      lastPerformed: {
        performed_at: "2025-10-20",
        sets_completed: 4,
        reps_completed: [10, 10, 8, 8],
        load_completed: [100, 100, 100, 95],
        rpe_reported: 7
      },
      avgLoad: 98.8,
      loadsProgression: {
        first: 80.0,
        last: 100.0,
        progressionPct: 25.0
      },
      recentHistory: [ /* last 5 performances */ ]
    }
  }
  ```

**Integration:**
- Called automatically during context collection
- Added to `userData.loadHistory` object
- Available to all AI coaches via context-collector
- Cache schema version bumped to 2.3.0

**Performance:**
- Efficient queries with optimized indexes
- Statistics pre-calculated during fetch
- Recent history limited to 5 performances for brevity

## üìä Data Structure Available to AI Coaches

### Before (Phase 0):
```typescript
{
  recentExercises: {
    "Squat": {
      frequency: 3,
      lastUsed: "2025-10-20",
      avgRPE: 7.5
      // ‚ùå NO LOAD DATA
    }
  }
}
```

### After (Phase 1):
```typescript
{
  // Previous data still available
  recentExercises: { /* same as before */ },

  // NEW: Detailed load history
  loadHistory: {
    totalRecords: 150,
    uniqueExercises: 45,
    monthsCovered: 12,
    exerciseHistory: {
      "squat": {
        totalPerformances: 12,
        lastPerformed: {
          performed_at: "2025-10-20T14:30:00Z",
          sets_completed: 4,
          reps_completed: [8, 8, 6, 6],
          load_completed: [100, 100, 100, 95],
          rpe_reported: 8,
          was_modified: false
        },
        avgLoad: 92.5,
        loadsProgression: {
          first: 80.0,  // 12 months ago
          last: 100.0,  // most recent
          progressionPct: 25.0  // +25% progression
        },
        recentHistory: [
          { performed_at: "2025-10-20", load: [100, 100, 100, 95], rpe: 8 },
          { performed_at: "2025-10-13", load: [95, 95, 95, 90], rpe: 7 },
          { performed_at: "2025-10-06", load: [90, 90, 90, 85], rpe: 7 },
          { performed_at: "2025-09-29", load: [90, 90, 85, 85], rpe: 6 },
          { performed_at: "2025-09-22", load: [85, 85, 85, 80], rpe: 6 }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## üéì AI Coach Can Now Answer:

### ‚úÖ "What load did user last use for squats?"
```typescript
loadHistory.exerciseHistory.squat.lastPerformed.load_completed
// [100, 100, 100, 95]
```

### ‚úÖ "Has user been progressing on squats?"
```typescript
loadHistory.exerciseHistory.squat.loadsProgression
// { first: 80kg, last: 100kg, progressionPct: +25%, trend: "strong_progression" }
```

### ‚úÖ "How often does user perform squats?"
```typescript
loadHistory.exerciseHistory.squat.totalPerformances // 12 times in last 12 months
```

### ‚úÖ "What's appropriate progression for next session?"
AI can now intelligently propose:
- Last load was [100, 100, 100, 95]
- User has +25% progression over 12 months
- RPE was 8 (hard but manageable)
- **Propose: [102.5, 102.5, 100, 100]** ‚úÖ

1. ‚úÖ Know exactly what loads users used previously
2. ‚úÖ Propose intelligent progressions (100kg ‚Üí 102.5kg)
3. ‚úÖ Track long-term trends (weeks, months, years)
4. ‚úÖ Avoid repetitive exercises while maintaining progression
5. ‚úÖ Base decisions on actual performance data, not guesses

The foundation for intelligent, data-driven progression is now in place.
